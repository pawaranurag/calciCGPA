                         A Mini Project By :
				
				Name  = ANURAG BHUJANGRAO PAWAR
				Class = SECOND YEAR 
				Branch= INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
				Batch = S(3)
				MIS no= 111408047

OBJECTIVES :-			
				The objectives of the project is as 2 ways:
		1->One programe session in this project is CGPA calculator.It contains verious operation which 
		needed to doing CGPA calculation. This CGPA calculator shows quick result as compare to the our hand writted calculation.
		the objective of CGPA calculator is to develop such idea's about CGPA calculation. this CGPA calculator improves speed
		of our working about that field.this CGPA calculator's aim towards Pointer based result college's.
		
		2-> Second type in the programme is calculator. this calculator entertaining but not so high technology logic.
		this calculator will result about sum,minus,division,multiply,modulus,power and factorial.this will be result in short 			terms and time.


FEATURES :-
		This calculator will performs work like that--
			1-> To finding grade pointer of student which is very difficult to solve
			2-> To perform's mathematical calculation like +,-,*,/,%,^,! Etc.....

INTERFACE :-
		This will be interfaced with college which gives result with graded pointer like IIT,NIT, AUTONOUMUS COLLEGE IN INDIA...
		and mathematical calculation will be helpful sample calculation useful for from student to bank manangement.

ADVANTAGES :-

		This project maintainance is easily.
		this project is easy to run without coming any difficulties....
		this project is easy, simple to handle it. and maitained by cultured calculator related person...

LIMITATION :- 
		CGPA calculator has not any limitation....it will be play in high condition....
		but Mathematical calculator does not follows high level integratrion or high level equation expression...

DESCIPTION OF WORK:->
		this project so contain 2 type programe , 1 is CGPA and another 1 is MATHEMATICAL CALCULATOR.
		CGPA will perform very neatly...it contains FORMULA to getting result...so we will get easily our semister grade pointer.
 		This project will be show us that what a logic is used. In that CGPA calculator is very interesting calculator.
		CGPA calculator's logic is very very good.This contain CGPA Formula. when we enter all student details then 
		it will declared us result .
		2nd part of programme is mathematical calculation like +,-,*,!,?,/,% etc. this will perform such operation.
